## LAB5 - Implementing a last-mile monitoring
---

### Exercise 1- Using Catchpoint for lst-mile monitoring

A cloud-based monitoring service can be used to cover last-mile monitoring. If that service is available, it can be used to replace meta-monitoring, provided that meta-monitoring endpoints are accessible from the Internet as REST APIs or health-check URLs.



### Conclusion

A combination of access to public cloud-based infrastructure and SaaS based monitoring services eliminate the need to build meta-monitoring explicitly. However you still need to ensure that your monitoring is monitored. It is important that your monitoring infrastructure and processes cover all the requirements of meta-monitoring to make the overall monitoring system highly reliable.
